           Hello! My name is PELUMI.
           I'm a Lagos based fitness trainer . I discovered a passion to help people get fit and eat healthily about 15 years ago. Since then I have worked with many clients to help them reach both their fitness goals and discover healthier eating choices.
           I work with clients with a variety of goals. Some want to get fit, some want to shift some weight, some want to eat healthily but don't want the annoyance of having to slave over the stove for hours & some just want to try new recipes without having to experiment first. This is where I come in! I will work with you to find out your goals, what you want to do and together we can develop a plan that will help you hit your targets.  
           As a father of three, I discovered how beneficial it was having my kids join me while I was doing yoga. They loved it and saw it as fun, and I reaped the benefits of them being calmer & happier.
           Get in contact & find out more about how I can help you or your children reach your goals!</i> </p>
			<p><i>For me, being active is like oxygen, it keeps me alive and along with cooking, it is one of my biggest passion. 
			No matter who we are, we should all be exercising.  It's so important that we engage in some form of consistent physical activity in order to maintain a healthy mind and body. 
			Finding an activity where you have a blast and some fun is imperative for being consistent with your exercise.  And most importantly, we need to be working with our bodies, and not against it. When we move with ease through an activity, we will grow and get stronger than you can ever imagine.</i></p> 
			<p><i>I have trained in many different disciplines, being a sport man with a degree in Human KInetiks from the university of Lagos, i use sports (football and basketball) as a medium to train my clients to achieve there goals and brings joy to my clients' heart.
			 Working with me, you will find the best way for you to be moving and growing stronger.
			If you have specific goals in mind or training for a special event, I can help you get there faster.  Mixing up your training and targeting the specific areas where you need to concentrate or that will help you beat those personal targets.
		    I believe that training and exercising should be challenging but most importantly, fun!  
			After training with me, I want you to leave with a sense of accomplishment, feeling better and happier than when you walked in.</i></p>
